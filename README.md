# Odin-recipes 
#This project is going to be a recipes website. 
#once completed it will be used to showcase my skills when using an html boiler plate.
#Upon completing this project I believe I have effectively displayed my ability to utilize html to insert and #edit/scale images and text, as well as insert links which helped me create a simple a straight forward #directory chain allow the user to easily navigate the webpage I have created. 
#some things I could have stood to improve on was writing better commit messages to have committed code more #often which would help those who wish to see or learn from my repository understand it easier.
